allocateAndCopy function first check if the current value is valid  then it
copies the data then allocate the resource and get copy the string and then return
if it is valid or not.

a copy constructor and assignment operator is needed because it is to use to copy a resource from 
another location and create a seperate allocated resource that allow you to compare the resource
within.
