1. isEmpty() member function was not necessary because
you never check if the object is empty or not. Even when the 
strength goes to 0 it will only  display that the object is
either 0 or lower.

2. The privacy access level is class level

3. To modify the solution you need to put the strength into the public instead

4. To modify the solution to create the outcome of "(name) the deceased superhero!"
you will need to modify the display file within the SuperHero.cpp file. You will need
to add the name after the cout or before the "living superhero!".

5. Line 35 can compile because there are more parameter within the superhero class than the hero class
therefore the hero class takes the first 2 parameter in and create an object with it.
