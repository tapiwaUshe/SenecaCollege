1. virtual function are function that allow other class to use the function
with the same function call.

2. The difference between virtual and pure virtual method are pure virtual allows
it children to implement the function while virtual cannot.
 
3. Abstract classes can only be implement through pure virtual function, they are 
useful in this application because it allows the childrens function to inherit 
it functions even if they parents did not implement it.

4. What are interfaces and why were they useful in the application we created for this workshop?
Interfaces are class that has no pure function in them, they are useful because sometimes
the certain class does not require the function but their children require it. So it allows
their children to implement instead.

5. Abstruct and interface are not necessarily the same thing but they are really similar
to each other because both of function type take in the same concept.
