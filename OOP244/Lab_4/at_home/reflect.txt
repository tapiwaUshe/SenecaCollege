1) 
	a. The safe empty state in this program is the setEmpty function.
	b. Function set an object to a default value instead of arbitrary
	   value that is store inside the object.

2) Having different type of constructor allow the object to store different type of
   value. By using the multiple Enrollment constructors, we can add different type of
   default value within the program. Some example can be, different Student can have a different
   constructor so the variable that store inside will be different than other student.
