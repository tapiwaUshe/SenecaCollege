1. For this workshop the feature that I used to help me solve the problem 
   is the display functions because the main objective of the at_home part
   of the assignment is to change the display out come compare to the in_lab.
   On my part of the program I changed a bit on how the display function retrieve
   it data. Some of the changes I have made are adding boolean to the function.
   Making condition to check if it meets the requirement.

2. It is able to print the account is not valid because of the missing semicolon
   by removing the semicolon it allow the while loop to read the next line of the
   program then stop and loop back up to the start of the loop.
